Here lives the code that is mentioned in the "Maintainable test automation framework with Spock, etc." talk from Automation Guild 2020

Please note that none of this is code that is ready to use!

You can find the files used for a demo in the "demo-files" folder. They only contain enough code to demonstrate the tips and tricks from the conference talk.

"boilerplate" folder contains a mock project that can be used as a guide to setup a Jenkins pipeline that will run a Spock+Selenide test framework. It contains some useful code for data manipulations and data loading, as well as an example of using annotations to split tests into groups.
